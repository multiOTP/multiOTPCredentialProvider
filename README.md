PREREQUISITES
=============
- last x86 AND x64 MSVC++ redistribuable installed (Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015, 2017 and 2019)
  https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x86.exe and https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe
- installed multiOTP server(s)
- configured multiOTP user (multiOTP username = [domain user name] or [windows local account name] or [microsoft account name])


MANUAL INSTALLATION
===================
Launch the installer (in the installer directory) and configure the various parameters during the setup. You must have administrator access to successfully install the multiOTP Credential Provider.
Which Authenticatio Mode should I choose?
   "OTP authentication mandatory for remote remote desktop only"       User must have OTP only when the login is done using remote desktop (mstsc). User logs in locally on the computer with the Windows password only.
   "OTP authentication mandatory for local logon and remote desktop"   User must have OTP when login is done using remote desktop (mstsc) or when it's done locally on the computer.
   "OTP and std auth. for local and remote (to check OTP validation)"  User can login with OTP or without OTP using remote desktop (mstsc) or locally on the computer.


MSI DEPLOYMENT
==============
Be sure that last x86 AND x64 MSVC++ redistribuable are installed.
If it's not the case, you can deploy them automatically using the four MSI provided in the vc_redist_MSI.zip file

Using Orca, you can create Transform files in order to set the settings of the credential provider.<br>
The following properties can be set :<br>
    MULTIOTP_TIMEOUT           Number of seconds to wait for the multiOTP server response. Default value 5.<br>
    MULTIOTP_CACHE             0|1 1 to enable local cache.<br>
    MULTIOTP_CPUSCREDUI        run as admin mode (0 or 1 or 2 + e or d for example 1e)<br>
    MULTIOTP_TIMEOUTCP         Number of seconds to wait for the credentail provider to respond. Default value 60.<br>
    MULTIOTP_TWO_STEP_HIDE_OTP 0|1 1 to force the credential to request an OTP password in a second step.<br>
    MULTIOTP_TWO_STEP_SEND_PASSWORD 0|1 1 to enable the credential to request an OTP password by SMS or e-mail.<br>    
    MULTIOTP_CPUSLOGON         logon mode (0 or 1 or 2 + e or d for example 1e)<br>

    MULTIOTP_DISPLAYSMSLINK    0|1 1 to enable the sms link on the OTP authentication page.<br>
    MULTIOTP_DISPLAYEMAILLINK  0|1 1 to enable the e-mail link on the OTP authentication page.<br>
    MULTIOTP_LOGINTEXT         text displayed underneath the credential logo.<br>
    MULTIOTP_BITMAP_PATH       The complete path and filename of the bmp image. Size must be 128x128 pixels.<br>
    MULTIOTP_URL               FQDN of the multiOTP server for example https://192.168.1.188<br>
    MULTIOTP_SECRET            Secret shared with the smultiOTP server.<br>
    MULTIOTP_OTP_TEXT          Text displayed in the OTP field.<br>

    MULTIOTP_UPNFORMAT         0|1 1 to use UPN format (kevin@test.com instead of kevin) for the username when credential provider calls multiOTP.<br>
	

Copy the MSI and MST files to a share which is accessible in Read-Execute for every computers

Create a GPO that applies to the selected computers, adding the following settings:
  Computer Settings > Administrative Templates > System > Logon
    Always wait for the network at computer startup and logon - Enabled

Create a second GPO that applies to the selected computers, adding the following settings:
  Computer Configuration > Policies > Administrative Templates > System > Group Policy
    Enable the Specify startup policy processing wait time. Set Amount of time to wait (in seconds): = 120

If x86 AND x64 MSVC++ redistributable are not already installed on those computers,
create a GPO to deploy the 4 x86 AND x64 MSVC++ redistribuable files.

Finaly, create a GPO that applies to the selected computers to deploy the MSI with its MST file

To force to apply the GPO on the selected computers:
gpupdate /force /boot on each computer, using administrator privilege


LOCAL ONLY STRONG AUTHENTICATION INSTALLATION
=============================================
1) Install the multiOTP Credential Provider, which contains also multiOTP inside.
2) Using the wizard, answer to the different questions
3) To disable the Credential Provider, uninstall it from Windows,
   or execute multiOTPCredentialProvider-unregister.reg


CENTRALIZED STRONG AUTHENTICATION INSTALLATION (with cache support)
===================================================================

   (https://www.multiOTP.com or https://www.multiOTP.net)
2) On each client, install the multiOTP Credential Provider.
3) Using the wizard, type the URL of the multiOTP server(s).
4) To disable the Credential Provider, uninstall it from Windows,
   or execute multiOTPCredentialProvider-unregister.reg


UNINSTALLATION
==============

TECHNICAL DETAILS
=================
- the credential provider DLL (multiOTPCredentialProvider.dll) is installed in the system folder \Windows\System32
- the credential provider options are stored in the following registry key
  (registry entries have priority over multiotp.ini file entries): HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\{FCEFDFAB-B0A1-4C4D-8B2B-4FF4E0A3D978}
- the previous registry keys (up to 5.8.1.x) are converted to the new values
- the available registry keys are
   * cpus_logon                    Logon authentication type [0|1|2|3][e|d]<br>
                                 0: relevant for remote (RDP) and local operation<br>
                                 1: relevant for remote operation<br>
                                 2: relevant for local operation<br>
                                 3: relevent for remote and local operation - but multiOTP Credential Provider is completely disabled.<br>
                                 e: Only the multiOTP Credential Provider is available. All other credential providers are not available.<br>
                                 d: In addition all other credential providers are available.<br>
                                 Example: cpus_logon = 0e: Only the multiOTP Credential Provider is available for Logon via remote and locally.<br>

   * multiOTPCacheEnabled          [1|0], used directly by multiOTP
   * multiOTPDefaultPrefix         [Default computer/domain, default is '']. multiOTP use automatically the domain name as default, or computer
                                 name if the computer is not in a domain. You can set here a manual default computer/domain, like for example '.'
   * multiOTPDisplaySmsLink        [0|1]
   * multiOTPDisplayEmailLink      [0|1]
   * multiOTPServers               [multiOTP server(s) to contact, default is 'https://192.168.1.88'], used directly by multiOTP
   * multiOTPServerTimeout         [timeout in seconds before switching to the next server, default is 5], used directly by multiOTP
   * multiOTPSharedSecret          [secret to connect this client to the server, default is 'ClientServerSecret'], used directly by multiOTP
